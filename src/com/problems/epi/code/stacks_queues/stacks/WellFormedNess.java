     * Key Insight: For every left symbol, you need to find a matching right symbol.
     * Important: The order of the right symbol matters because the last left symbol seen must match the first right symbol found.
     * This mimics a stack of LIFO. hence, use a Stack, to store all left symbols found.
     * If a right symbol is encountered, check the top of the stack and see if the left symbol there matches the right symbol found.
     * If not there, the string is not well-formed.
     * Note that it might seem obvious to use six count variables to keep a count of left and right versions of the three symbols
     * HOWEVER, this would not work for the input case were "([)]" since the ORDERING matters in this problem.
     * Time Complexity: O(n)
     * Space Complexity: O(n) (cannot do better; maybe better if there was only one type of symbol (use counter variables))
