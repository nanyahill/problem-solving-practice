    /**
     * Key idea- Floyd's tortoise and hare algorithm- There are two distinct phases:
     * 1) Determine the point of intersection: Use two pointers where one pointer moves twice as fast as the other pointer.
     * This way the faster one gets one step closer to the slower at each turn of the cycle, if there is one.
     * In the end, the slow and fast will eventually meet (This shows that the loop has a cycle and gives an intersection point).
     * 2) Determine the start of the cycle- 2(dist of tortoise (i.e dist tortoise has covered within the cycle)) = dist of hare.
     * Explanation of phase 2: When they meet tortoise would have travelled F + a distance
     * where F is the length before cycle starts and a is the length travelled within the cycle.
     * If the length of the cycle is a + b,
     * Then hare would have traveled F + a + b + a before it meets with tortoise.
     * The length b is the dist to the start of the cycle.
     * One of the pointers is moved to the head of the list, and the second pointer stays at the point of intersection.
     * Then both pointers advance together one step at a time; they will meet after travelling a distance of b.
     * Time Complexity: O(n)
     * Space Complexity: O(1)
